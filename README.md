## Feature Documentation

### Basic Features

#### Browsing Content
- **List books and articles**: Retrieve your saved books with pagination
- **Get highlights**: Access all your highlighted passages with filtering options
- **Search content**: Full-text search across your entire library
- **Get recent content**: Quickly access your latest saved items

### Tag Management

Organize your content with tags:

- **List all tags**: Get all tags in your library
- **Get tags for a document**: View tags on a specific document
- **Update tags**: Replace all tags on a document
- **Add a specific tag**: Add a single tag to a document
- **Remove a specific tag**: Remove a tag from a document
- **Bulk tagging**: Apply tags to multiple documents at once

### Advanced Search

Powerful filtering options for finding exactly what you need:

- `query`: Search text
- `category`: Filter by content type (book, article, etc.)
- `tags`: Filter by tags (comma-separated)
- `author`: Filter by author
- `title`: Filter by title
- `location`: Filter by location (new, later, archive, feed)
- `dateFrom` & `dateTo`: Date range in ISO 8601 format
- `sortBy`: Field to sort by (created_at, updated_at, title, author)
- `sortOrder`: Sort direction (asc, desc)

### Reading Progress Tracking

Track your reading status and progress:

- **Get reading progress**: View current progress on any document
- **Update reading progress**: Set status, percentage, and page numbers
- **Get reading list**: Filter by reading status

Reading statuses:
- `not_started`: Haven't begun reading
- `in_progress`: Currently reading
- `completed`: Finished reading

### Video Features

Access and interact with videos saved in your Readwise Reader:

#### Video Listing and Details

- **List all videos**: Browse videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and other platforms
- **Get video details with transcript**: Access complete metadata and time-synced transcripts

#### Video Highlights

- **Create highlight with timestamp**: Mark important moments in videos
- **Get video highlights**: Retrieve all highlights for a video, sorted by timestamp

#### Video Playback Position

- **Update playback position**: Save your current position for later resuming
- **Get playback position**: Resume where you left off

#### How Transcript Access Works

The video transcript feature:
1. Extracts the time-synced transcript from the video's HTML content
2. Parses timestamp and text pairs
3. Returns transcript as an array of segments with timestamps

This allows you to:
- Search for specific content within videos
- Create highlights at precise moments
- Jump directly to important points
- Reference video content with exact time context

### Content Management

Save, update, and delete content:

- **Save new content**: Add URLs, articles, or custom content to your library
- **Update document**: Modify title, author, summary, tags, and more
- **Delete document**: Remove content (with safety confirmation)

### Bulk Operations

Efficiently manage multiple documents at once:

- **Bulk save**: Save multiple URLs/content items
- **Bulk update**: Update multiple documents
- **Bulk delete**: Remove multiple documents
- **Bulk tag**: Apply tags to multiple documents

#### Safety Confirmations

All bulk operations and deletions require explicit confirmation to prevent accidental data loss:

- **Single document deletion**: Requires confirmation parameter
- **Bulk operations**: Require specific confirmation strings

These confirmations act as a "human in the loop" safety mechanism.

## Integration

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config:
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "readwise": {
      "command": "readwise-mcp",
      "env": {
        "READWISE_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "readwise": {
      "command": "readwise-mcp",
      "env": {
        "READWISE_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Install via CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add readwise-mcp --transport http https://server.smithery.ai/@IAmAlexander/readwise-mcp/mcp
```

Or use the JSON config format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "readwise-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://server.smithery.ai/@IAmAlexander/readwise-mcp/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment

### Smithery

Install via Smithery CLI:
```bash
npx @smithery/cli install @iamalexander/readwise-mcp --client claude
```

Or find it on the [Smithery Registry](https://smithery.ai/server/@IAmAlexander/readwise-mcp).

### Railway (One-Click Deploy)

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/readwise-mcp)

1. Click the button above or go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Add environment variables:
   - `READWISE_API_KEY`: Your Readwise API token
   - `SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`: (Optional) Authentication token to protect MCP endpoint access
4. Deploy!

**Connecting with Authentication:**
```bash
# If SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN is set, clients must authenticate:
# Option 1: Bearer token header (recommended)
Authorization: Bearer your_token_here

# Option 2: Query parameter (works but less secure)
https://your-app.railway.app/mcp?token=your_token_here
```

### Render

1. Create a new Web Service on [Render](https://render.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Render will auto-detect `render.yaml`
4. Add environment variable: `READWISE_API_KEY`
5. Deploy!

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t readwise-mcp .
docker run -p 3001:3001 -e READWISE_API_KEY=your_key readwise-mcp
```

## Troubleshooting

### Token Issues

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Verify your Readwise API token is still valid at <https://readwise.io/access_token>
2. Reset authentication by deleting stored credentials:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.readwise-mcp/credentials.json
   ```
3. Restart and try connecting again

### Connection Issues

If the server cannot connect:

1. Ensure the server is running (if manually started)
2. Check that port 3001 is not being used by another application
3. Restart your AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

### Rate Limiting

The server includes built-in rate limiting. If you encounter rate limit errors:

1. Wait a few minutes before trying again
2. Reduce the frequency of requests
3. Check the rate limit headers in responses

### Video-Specific Issues

1. **Missing transcripts**: Not all videos have transcripts. YouTube videos typically have the best support.
2. **Transcript quality**: Transcripts are from the video platform and may contain errors.
3. **Timestamp inconsistencies**: Different platforms use different formats; the API normalizes when possible.
4. **Playback position not updating**: Ensure both `position` and `duration` parameters are provided.

## Privacy & Security

- Your Readwise API token is stored securely on your local machine
- Your Readwise data is only accessed when explicitly requested
- No data is permanently stored on the MCP server
- Safety confirmations prevent accidental data loss

## Development

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Start in development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev:watch

# Lint code
npm run lint
```
